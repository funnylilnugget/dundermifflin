Hey Princess Bubblegum, when we bring the dead back to life will it be filled with worms? No. If my decorpsinator serum works all the dead Candy People will look as young and healthy as you do. Pick up that platter, tough guy. Old Mr. Creampuff? We used to date. Somethings happening!<br><br>
        Come on, come on... Work. Algebraic! Wait, somethings wrong. SUGAR! Ew! Hey look, the decorpsinator serum is working! No, this is wrong. Theyre not coming back to life theyre still dead! The decorpsinator serum its incomplete! Must eat sugar! Youre grounded, Mister. Oh, this is really bad. Theyre going to be attracted to the Candy Kingdom! Why? Because the Candy People are made of sugar, ya ding dong!
